# README

This is a Ruby on Rails prototype applications that renders an emergency summary template in a narrative form, parsing and interpolating different placeholders from persisted data.

To test the app clone the repository, run 'bundle install', 'rake db:migrate', 'rake db:seed' and start the server 'rails server'.

Go to 'localhost:3000/patients' to see a list of all the patients. Click on a patient from the list to view the corresponding emergency summary.
